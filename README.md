Algorithm Challenge #29 – Sum Even Numbers from 1 to N
---
🧮 Problem Description
---
This challenge focuses on calculating the sum of all even numbers from 1 to N using a for loop in C++.
It’s a great way to practice selective iteration and arithmetic accumulation in loops.

💡 What You’ll Learn
---
Using for loops with custom increments (i += 2)

Handling sequences of even numbers

Performing cumulative summations

Managing user input and validating values

🧩 Example
---
Input:
Enter a positive number:  10

Output:
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 is:  30

📂 File Information
---
Language: C++
File Name: sum_even_numbers_1_to_n.cpp
Challenge Number: #29

💬 Notes
---
This exercise reinforces the concept of iteration with controlled steps and demonstrates how to efficiently handle even-number patterns in algorithms.
It’s a solid foundation for problems involving series, mathematical progressions, and selective summation.
